During a discussion with a colleague I was caused to reflect on my career.
With that, I discovered that I have worked at some form of a SaaS company for
the majority of my career.

SaaS is everywhere. Wikipedia says
> Software as a service (SaaS /s√¶s/[1]) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted.[2][3] SaaS is also known as on-demand software, web-based software, or web-hosted software.
