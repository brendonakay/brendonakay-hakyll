title: Bootstrapping my blog

I've been learning functional programming lately. I know that writing
can help distill thoughts and ideas. I've always wanted to work on a personal
brand, so here I am with my initial blog post.

Haskell has been a rewarding language to learn. I think it's been the most
fulfilling out of the languages I've tried so far; Scala, some LISP dialects,
trying to write functional Go. So, I figured a good initial post could be me
getting started with my very own Hakyll website.

# Getting started
## Setting up my development environment.
NeoVim, HLS, Stack
