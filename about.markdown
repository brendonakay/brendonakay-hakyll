title: Me
---

I am a software engineer with a passion for functional programming and
mathematics.

I have professional experience in data-intensive web applications. My preferred
tools include Go or Haskell, AWS or GCP, SQLite or Postgres, and HTMX or React.
However, these preferences are not superseded by the wisdom, "Use the right
tool for the job".

Besides my professional work, I am deeply interested in functional
programming and related math topics, such as Abstract Algebra, Category Theory,
Type Theory, and Algorithms.
