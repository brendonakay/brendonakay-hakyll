title: About
---
My name is Brendon Alan Kay, which I usually abbreviate Brendon A. Kay. To
distinguish me from all of the other Brendon Kays.

Lately obsessed with functional programming. I've always been interested in the
intersection between math and computer science. Functional programming bridges
that gap nicely.

## Mathematical interests

* Algorithms
* Linear Algebra
* Calculus, unfortunately
* Category Theory applied to Functional Programming

## Tools
I love using NeoVim as an editor and I aspire to create my own plugin one day.
