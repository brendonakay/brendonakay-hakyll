title: About
---

Software Engineer with a passion for functional programming and mathematics.

I have professional experience in data-intensive web applications. My preferred
tools include Go, AWS or GCP, SQLite or Postgres, and HTMX or React. However,
these preferences are not superseded by the wisdom, "Use the right tool for the
job".

Besides my professional experience, I am deeply interested in functional
programming and related mathemaical topics.
